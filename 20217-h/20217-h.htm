<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="REMARKS" id="REMARKS"></a>REMARKS.</h2>


<p>There seems to be required by a number of well meaning persons of the
present day a degree of moral perfection in a play, which few literary
works attain; and in which sermons, and other holy productions, are at
times deficient, though written with the purest intention.</p>

<p>To criticise any book, besides the present drama, was certainly not a
premeditated design in writing this little essay; but in support of the
position&mdash;that every literary work, however guided by truth, may
occasionally swerve into error, it may here be stated that the meek
spirit of christianity can seldom be traced in any of those pious
writings where our ancient religion, the church of Rome, and its clergy,
are the subjects: and that political writers, in the time of war,
laudably impelled, will slander public enemies into brutes, that the
nation may hate them without offence to brotherly love.</p>

<p>Articles of sacred faith are often so piously, yet so ignorantly
expounded in what are termed systems of education and instruction&mdash;that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>doubts are created, where all was before secure, and infidelity sown,
where it was meant to be extirpated.</p>

<p>In this general failure of human perfection, the German author of this
play has compassionated&mdash;and with a high, a sublime, example before
him&mdash;an adultress. But Kotzebue's pity, vitiated by his imperfect
nature, has, it is said, deviated into vice; by restoring this woman to
her former rank in life, under the roof of her injured husband.</p>

<p>To reconcile to the virtuous spectator this indecorum, most calamitous
woes are first depicted as the consequence of illicit love. The deserted
husband and the guilty wife are both presented to the audience as
voluntary exiles from society: the one through poignant sense of sorrow
for the connubial happiness he has lost&mdash;the other, from deep contrition
for the guilt she has incurred.</p>

<p>The language, as well as the plot and incidents, of this play, describe,
with effect, those multiplied miseries which the dishonour of a wife
spreads around; but draws more especially upon herself, her husband, and
her children.</p>

<p>Kemble's emaciated frame, sunken eye, drooping head, and death-like
paleness; his heart-piercing lamentation, that&mdash;"he trusted a friend who
repaid his hospitality, by alluring from him all that his soul held
dear,"&mdash;are potent warnings to the modern husband.</p>

<p>Mrs. Siddons, in Mrs. Haller (the just martyr to her own crimes) speaks
in her turn to every married woman; and, in pathetic bursts of grief&mdash;in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>looks of overwhelming shame&mdash;in words of deep reproach against herself
and her seducer&mdash;"conjures each wife to revere the marriage bond."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these distressful and repentant testimonies,
preparatory to the reunion of this husband and wife, a delicate
spectator feels a certain shudder when the catastrophe takes place,&mdash;but
there is another spectator more delicate still, who never conceives,
that from an agonizing, though an affectionate embrace, (the only proof
of reconciliation given, for the play ends here), any farther
endearments will ensue, than those of participated sadness, mutual care
of their joint offspring, and to smooth each other's passage to the
grave.</p>

<p>But should the worst suspicion of the scrupulous critic be true, and
this man should actually have taken his wife "for better or for worse,"
as on the bridal day&mdash;can this be holding out temptation, as alleged,
for women to be false to their husbands? Sure it would rather act as a
preservative. What woman of common understanding and common cowardice,
would dare to dishonour and forsake her husband, if she foresaw she was
ever likely to live with him again?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<h2>ACT THE FIRST.</h2>

<h3>SCENE I.</h3>

<p class="stage-dir-center"><i>The Skirts of</i> <span class="smcap">Count Wintersen's</span> <i>Park.&mdash;The Park Gates in the
centre.&mdash;On one side a low Lodge, among the Trees.&mdash;On the other, in the
back ground, a Peasant's Hut.</i></p>

<p class="stage-dir-center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Peter</span>.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> Pooh! pooh!&mdash;never tell me.&mdash;I'm a clever lad, for all father's
crying out every minute, "Peter," and "stupid Peter!" But I say, Peter
is not stupid, though father will always be so wise. First, I talk too
much; then I talk too little; and if I talk a bit to myself, he calls me
a driveller. Now, I like best to talk to myself; for I never contradict
myself, and I don't laugh at myself, as other folks do. That laughing is
often a plaguy teazing custom. To be sure, when Mrs. Haller laughs, one
can bear it well enough; there is a sweetness even in her reproof, that
somehow&mdash;But, lud! I had near forgot what I was sent about.&mdash;Yes, then
they would have laughed at me indeed.&mdash;[<i>Draws a green purse from his
pocket.</i>]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>&mdash;I am to carry this money to old Tobias; and Mrs. Haller said
I must be sure not to blab, or say that she had sent it. Well, well, she
may be easy for that matter; not a word shall drop from my lips. Mrs.
Haller is charming, but silly, if father is right; for father says, "He,
that spends his money is not wise," but "he that gives it away, is stark
mad."</p>

<p class="stage-dir-center"><i>Enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Stranger</span>, <i>from the Lodge, followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Francis</span>.&mdash;<i>At sight
of</i> <span class="smcap">Peter</span>, <i>the</i> <span class="smcap">Stranger</span> <i>stops, and looks suspiciously at him.</i> <span class="smcap">Peter</span>
<i>stands opposite to him, with his mouth wide open. At length he takes
off his hat, scrapes a bow, and goes into the Hut.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Who is that?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> The steward's son.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Of the Castle?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Yes.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> [<i>After a pause.</i>] You were&mdash;you were speaking last night&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Of the old countryman?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Ay.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> You would not hear me out.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Proceed.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> He is poor.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Who told you so?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Himself.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> [<i>With acrimony.</i>] Ay, ay; he knows how to tell his story, no
doubt.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> And to impose, you think?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Right!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> This man does not.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Fool!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> A feeling fool is better than a cold sceptic.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> False!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Charity begets gratitude.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> False!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> And blesses the giver more than the receiver.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> True.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Well, sir. This countryman&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Has he complained to you?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Yes.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> He, who is really unhappy, never complains. [<i>Pauses.</i>] Francis,
you have had means of education beyond your lot in life, and hence you
are encouraged to attempt imposing on me:&mdash;but go on.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> His only son has been taken from him.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Taken from him?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> By the exigency of the times, for a soldier.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Ay!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> The old man is poor.&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> 'Tis likely.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Sick and forsaken.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> I cannot help him.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Yes.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> How?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> By money. He may buy his son's release.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> I'll see him myself.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Do so.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> But if he is an impostor!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> He is not.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> In that hut?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> In that hut. [<span class="smcap">Stranger</span> <i>goes into the Hut.</i>] A good master,
though one almost loses the use of speech by living with him. A man kind
and clear&mdash;though I cannot understand him. He rails against the whole
world, and yet no beggar leaves his door unsatisfied. I have now lived
three years with him, and yet I know not who he is. A hater of society,
no doubt; but not by Providence intended to be so. Misanthropy in his
head, not in his heart.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-center"><i>Enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Stranger</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Peter</span>, <i>from the Hut.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> Pray walk on.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Francis</span>.] Fool!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> So soon returned!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> What should I do there?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Did you not find it as I said?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> This lad I found.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> What has he to do with your charity?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> The old man and he understand each other perfectly well.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> How?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> What were this boy and the countryman doing?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> [<i>Smiling, and shaking his head.</i>] Well, you shall hear. [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Peter</span>.] Young man, what were you doing in that hut?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> Doing!&mdash;Nothing.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Well, but you couldn't go there for nothing?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> And why not, pray?&mdash;But I did go there for nothing, though.&mdash;Do
you think one must be paid for every thing?&mdash;If Mrs. Haller were to give
me but a smiling look, I'd jump up to my neck in the great pond for
nothing.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> It seems then Mrs. Haller sent you?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> Why, yes&mdash;But I'm not to talk about it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Why so?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> How should I know? "Look you," says Mrs. Haller, "Master Peter,
be so good as not to mention it to any body." [<i>With much consequence.</i>]
"Master Peter, be so good"&mdash;Hi! hi! hi!&mdash;"Master Peter, be so"&mdash;Hi! hi!
hi!&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Oh! that is quite a different thing. Of course you must be silent
then.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> I know that; and so I am too. For I told old Tobias&mdash;says I,
"Now, you're not to think as how Mrs. Haller sent the money; for I shall
not say a word about that as long as I live," says I.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> There you were very right. Did you carry him much money?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> I don't know; I didn't count it. It was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> a bit of a green
purse. Mayhap it may be some little matter that she has scraped together
in the last fortnight.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> And why just in the last fortnight?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> Because, about a fortnight since, I carried him some money
before.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> From Mrs. Haller?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> Ay, sure; who else, think you? Father's not such a fool. He says
it is our bounden duty, as christians, to take care of our money, and
not give any thing away, especially in summer; for then, says he,
there's herbs and roots enough in conscience to satisfy all the
reasonable hungry poor. But I say father's wrong, and Mrs. Haller's
right.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Yes, yes.&mdash;But this Mrs. Haller seems a strange woman, Peter.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> Ay, at times she is plaguy odd. Why, she'll sit, and cry you a
whole day through, without any one's knowing why.&mdash;Ay, and yet, somehow
or other, whenever she cries, I always cry too&mdash;without knowing why.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> [<i>To the</i> <span class="smcap">Stranger</span>.] Are you satisfied?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Rid me of that babbler.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Good day, Master Peter.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> You're not going yet, are you?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Mrs. Haller will be waiting for an answer.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> So she will. And I have another place or two to call at. [<i>Takes
off his hat to</i> <span class="smcap">Stranger</span>.] Servant, sir!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Pshaw!&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> Pshaw! What&mdash;he's angry. [<span class="smcap">Peter</span> <i>turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Francis</span>, <i>in a half
whisper.</i>] He's angry, I suppose, because he can get nothing out of me.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> It almost seems so.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> Ay, I'd have him to know I'm no blab.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Now, sir?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> What do you want?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Were you not wrong, sir?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Hem! wrong!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Can you still doubt?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> I'll hear no more! Who is this Mrs. Haller? Why do I always
follow her path? Go where I will, whenever I try to do good, she has
always been before me.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> You should rejoice at that.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Rejoice!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Surely! That there are other good and charitable people in the
world beside yourself.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Oh, yes!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Why not seek to be acquainted with her? I saw her yesterday in
the garden up at the Castle. Mr. Solomon, the steward, says she has been
unwell, and confined to her room almost ever since we have been here.
But one would not think it, to look at her; for a more beautiful
creature I never saw.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> So much the worse. Beauty is a mask.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> In her it seems a mirror of the soul. Her charities&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Talk not to me of her charities. All women wish to be
conspicuous:&mdash;in town by their wit; in the country by their heart.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> 'Tis immaterial in what way good is done.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> No; 'tis not immaterial.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> To this poor old man at least.</p>

me for another year or two.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> How old are you, pray?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Tob.</i> Seventy-six. To be sure I can expect but little joy before I die.
Yet, there is another, and a better world.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> To the unfortunate, then, death is scarce an evil?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Tob.</i> Am I so unfortunate? Do I not enjoy this glorious morning? Am I
not in health again! Believe me, sir, he, who, leaving the bed of
sickness, for the first time breathes the fresh pure air, is, at that
moment, the happiest of his Maker's creatures.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Yet 'tis a happiness that fails upon enjoyment.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Tob.</i> True; but less so in old age. Some fifty years ago my father left
me this cottage. I was a strong lad; and took an honest wife. Heaven
blessed my farm with rich crops, and my marriage with five children.
This lasted nine or ten years. Two of my children died. I felt it
sorely. The land was afflicted with a famine. My wife assisted me in
supporting our family: but four years after, she left our dwelling for a
better place. And of my five children only one son remained. This was
blow upon blow. It was long before I regained my fortitude. At length
resignation and religion had their effect. I again attached myself to
life. My son grew, and helped me in my work. Now the state has called
him away to bear a musket. This is to me a loss indeed. I can work no
more. I am old and weak; and true it is, but for Mrs. Haller, I must
have perished.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Still then life has its charms for you?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Tob.</i> Why not, while the world holds any thing that's dear to me? Have
not I a son?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Who knows, that you will ever see him more? He may be dead.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Tob.</i> Alas! he may. But as long as I am not sure of it, he lives to me:
And if he falls, 'tis in his coun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>try's cause. Nay, should I lose him,
still I should not wish to die. Here is the hut in which I was born.
Here is the tree that grew with me; and, I am almost ashamed to confess
it&mdash;I have a dog, I love.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> A dog!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Tob.</i> Yes!&mdash;Smile if you please: but hear me. My benefactress once came
to my hut herself, some time before you fixed here. The poor animal,
unused to see the form of elegance and beauty enter the door of penury,
growled at her.&mdash;"I wonder you keep that surly, ugly animal, Mr.
Tobias," said she; "you, who have hardly food enough for
yourself."&mdash;"Ah, madam," I replied, "if I part with him, are you sure
that any thing else will love me?"&mdash;She was pleased with my answer.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Stranger</span>.] Excuse me, sir; but I wish you had listened.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> I have listened.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Then, sir, I wish you would follow this poor old man's example.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> [<i>Pauses.</i>] Here; take this book, and lay it on my desk.
[<i>Francis goes into the Lodge with the book.</i>] How much has this Mrs.
Haller given you?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Tob.</i> Oh, sir, she has given me so much, that I can look towards winter
without fear.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> No more?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Tob.</i> What could I do with more?&mdash;Ah! true; I might&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> I know it.&mdash;You might buy your son's release.&mdash;There! [<i>Presses

<p class="dialogue-cont">&mdash;Now look, sir: is confidence in Heaven unrewarded?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Just like him. He sent me with his book, that no one might be

<p class="dialogue"><i>Tob.</i> He would not even take my thanks. He was gone before I could
speak.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Just his way.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Tob.</i> Now, I'll go as quick as these old legs will bear me. What a
delightful errand! I go to release my Robert! How the lad will rejoice!
There is a girl too, in the village, that will rejoice with him. O
Providence, how good art thou! Years of distress never can efface the
recollection of former happiness; but one joyful moment drives from the

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> Good morning, good morning to you, Mrs. Haller. It gives me
infinite pleasure to see you look so charmingly well. You have had the
goodness to send for your humble servant. Any news from the Great City?
There are very weighty matters in agitation. I have my letters too.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> [<i>Smiling.</i>] I think, Mr. Solomon, you must correspond with
the four quarters of the globe.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> Beg pardon, not with the whole world, Mrs. Haller: but
[<i>Consequentially.</i>] to be sure I have correspondents, on whom I can
rely, in the chief cities of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> And yet I have my doubts whether you know what is to happen
this very day at this very place.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> At this very place! Nothing material. We meant to have sown a

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> Well, now; what's the matter again?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> Call all the house together directly! Send to the game keeper;
tell him to bring some venison. Tell Rebecca to uncase the furniture,
and take the covering from the Venetian looking glasses, that her Right
Honourable Ladyship the Countess may look at her gracious countenance:
and tell the cook to let me see him without loss of time: and tell John
to catch a brace or two of carp. And tell&mdash;and tell&mdash;and tell&mdash;tell
Frederick to friz my Sunday wig.&mdash;Mercy on us!&mdash;Tell&mdash;There&mdash;Go!&mdash;
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Peter</span>.] Heavens and earth! so little of the new furnishing of
this old castle is completed!&mdash;Where are we to put his Honourable
Lordship the Baron?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Let him have the little chamber at the head of the stairs; it
is a neat room, and commands a beautiful prospect.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> Very right, very right. But that room has always been occupied by
the Count's private secretary. Suppose!&mdash;Hold, I have it. You know the
little lodge at the end of the park: we can thrust the secretary into
that.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> You forget, Mr. Solomon; you told me that the Stranger lived
there.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> Pshaw! What have we to do with the Stranger?&mdash;Who told him to
live there?&mdash;He must turn out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> That would be unjust; for you said, that you let the dwelling
to him, and by your own account he pays well for it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> He does, he does. But nobody knows who he is. The devil himself
can't make him out. To be sure, I lately received a letter from Spain,
which informed me that a spy had taken up his abode in this country, and
from the description&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> A spy! Ridiculous! Every thing I have heard bespeaks him to be
a man, who may be allowed to dwell any where. His life is solitude and
silence.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> So it is.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> You tell me too he does much good.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> That he does.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> He hurts nothing; not the worm in his way.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> That he does not.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> He troubles no one.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> True! true!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Well, what do you want more?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> I want to know who he is. If the man would only converse a
little, one might have an opportunity of <i>pumping</i>; but if one meets him
in the lime walk, or by the river, it is nothing but&mdash;"Good
morrow;"&mdash;and off he marches. Once or twice I have contrived to edge in
a word&mdash;"Fine day."&mdash;"Yes."&mdash;"Taking a little exercise, I
perceive."&mdash;"Yes:"&mdash;and off again like a shot. The devil take such close
fellows, say I. And, like master like man; not a syllable do I know of
that mumps his servant, except that his name is Francis.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> You are putting yourself into a passion, and quite forget who
are expected.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> So I do&mdash;Mercy on us!&mdash;There now, you see what misfortunes arise
from not knowing people.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> 'Tis near twelve o'clock already! If his lordship has stolen
an hour from his usual sleep, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> family must soon be here. I go to my
duty; you will attend to yours, Mr. Solomon.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> Yes, I'll look after my duty, never fear. There goes another of
the same class. Nobody knows who she is again. However, thus much I do
know of her, that her Right Honourable Ladyship the Countess, all at
once, popped her into the house, like a blot of ink upon a sheet of
paper. But why, wherefore, or for what reason, not a soul can
tell.&mdash;"She is to manage the family within doors." She to manage! Fire
and faggots! Haven't I managed every thing within and without, most
reputably, these twenty years? I must own I grow a little old, and she
does take a deal of pains: but all this she learned of me. When she
first came here&mdash;Mercy on us! she didn't know that linen was made of
flax. But what was to be expected from one who has no foreign
correspondence.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Madam, that title shall be doubly valuable to me, since it gives
me an introduction equally to be rejoiced at.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> [<i>Without attending to the compliment.</i>] This lovely weather,
then, has enticed the Count from the city?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Not exactly that. You know him. Sunshine or clouds are to him
alike, as long as eternal summer reigns in his own heart and family.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> The Count possesses a most cheerful and amiable philosophy.
Ever in the same happy humour;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> ever enjoying each minute of his life.
But you must confess, my lord, that he is a favourite child of fortune,
and has much to be grateful to her for. Not merely because she has given
him birth and riches, but for a native sweetness of temper, never to be
acquired; and a graceful suavity of manners, whose school must be the
mind. And, need I enumerate among fortune's favours, the hand and
affections of your accomplished sister?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> [<i>More and more struck as her understanding opens upon him.</i>]
True, madam. My good easy brother, too, seems fully sensible of his
happiness, and is resolved to retain it. He has quitted the service to
live here. I am yet afraid he may soon grow weary of Wintersen and
retirement.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> I should trust not. They, who bear a cheerful and
unreproaching conscience into solitude, surely must increase the measure
of their own enjoyments. They quit the poor, precarious, the dependent
pleasures, which they borrowed from the world, to draw a real bliss from
that exhaustless source of true delight, the fountain of a pure
unsullied heart.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Has retirement long possessed so lovely an advocate?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> I have lived here three years.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> And never felt a secret wish for the society you left, and must
have adorned?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Never.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> To feel thus belongs either to a very rough or a very polished
soul. The first sight convinced me in which class I am to place you.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> [<i>With a sigh.</i>] There may, perhaps, be a third class.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Indeed, madam, I wish not to be thought forward; but women always
seemed to me less calculated for retirement than men. We have a
thousand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> employments, a thousand amusements, which you have not.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Dare I ask what they are?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> We ride&mdash;we hunt&mdash;we play&mdash;read&mdash;write.&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> The noble employments of the chase, and the still more noble
employment of play, I grant you.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Nay, but dare I ask what are your employments for a day?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Oh, my lord! you cannot imagine how quickly time passes when a
certain uniformity guides the minutes of our life. How often do I ask,
"Is Saturday come again so soon?" On a bright cheerful morning, my books
and breakfast are carried out upon the grass plot. Then is the sweet
picture of reviving industry and eager innocence always new to me. The
birds' notes so often heard, still waken new ideas: the herds are led
into the fields: the peasant bends his eye upon his plough. Every thing
lives and moves; and in every creature's mind it seems as it were
morning. Towards evening I begin to roam abroad: from the park into the
meadows. And sometimes, returning, I pause to look at the village boys
and girls as they play. Then do I bless their innocence, and pray to
Heaven, those laughing, thoughtless hours, could be their lot for ever.</p>

the winter!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Why for ever picture winter like old age, torpid, tedious, and
uncheerful? Winter has its own delights: this is the time to instruct
and mend the mind by reading and reflection. At this season, too, I
often take my harp, and amuse myself by playing or singing the little
favourite airs that remind me of the past, or solicit hope for the
future.</p>

pleasures and employments.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

not alone.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Tob.</i> Oh! this good gentleman will forgive me.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> What do you want?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Tob.</i> To return thanks. Even charity is a burden if one may not be
grateful for it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> To-morrow, good Tobias; to-morrow.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Nay, no false delicacy, madam. Allow him to vent the feelings of
his heart; and permit me to witness a scene which convinces me, even
more powerfully than your conversation, how nobly you employ your time.
Speak, old man.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Tob.</i> Oh, lady, that each word which drops from my lips, might call
down a blessing on your head! I lay forsaken and dying in my hut: not
even bread nor hope remained. Oh! then you came in the form of an angel,
brought medicines to me; and your sweet consoling voice did more than
those. I am recovered. To-day, for the first time, I have returned
thanks in presence of the sun: and now I come to you, noble lady. Let me
drop my tears upon your charitable hand. For your sake, Heaven has
blessed my latter days. The Stranger too, who lives near me, has given
me a purse of gold to buy my son's release. I am on my way to the city:
I shall purchase my Robert's release. Then I shall have an honest
daughter-in-law. And you, if ever after that you pass our happy cottage,
oh! what must you feel when you say to yourself, "This is my work!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> What has thus alarmed and subdued me? My tears flow; my heart
bleeds. Already had I apparently overcome my chagrin: already had I at
least assumed that easy gaiety once so natural to me, when the sight of
this child in an instant overpowered me. When the Countess called him
William&mdash;Oh! she knew not that she plunged a poniard in my heart. I have
a William too, who must be as tall as this, if he be still alive. Ah!
yes, if he be still alive. His little sister too! Why, fancy, dost thou
rack me thus? Why dost thou image my poor children, fainting in
sickness, and crying to their mother? To the mother who has abandoned
them? [<i>Weeps.</i>] What a wretched outcast am I! And that just to-day I
should be doomed to feel these horrible emotions! just to-day, when
disguise was so necessary.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Charlotte</span>.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Char.</i> [<i>Entering.</i>] Very pretty, very pretty indeed; better send me to
the garret at once. Your servant, Mrs. Haller. I beg, madam, I may have
a room fit for a respectable person.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> The chamber into which you have been shown is, I think, a very
neat one.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Char.</i> A very neat one, is it? Up the back stairs, and over the
laundry! I should never be able to close my eyes.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> [<i>Very mildly.</i>] I slept there a whole year.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Char.</i> Did you? Then I advise you to remove into it again, and the
sooner the better. I'd have you to know, madam, there is a material
difference between certain persons and certain persons. Much depends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
upon the manner in which one has been educated. I think, madam, it would
only be proper if you resigned your room to me.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> If the Countess desires it, certainly.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Char.</i> The Countess! Very pretty, indeed! Would you have me think of
plaguing her ladyship with such trifles? I shall order my trunk to be
carried where-ever I please.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Certainly; only not into my chamber.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Char.</i> Provoking creature! But how could I expect to find breeding
among creatures born of one knows not whom, and coming one knows not
whence?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> The remark is very just.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Peter</span>, <i>in haste.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Drowned?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> Yes.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Dead?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> No; he's not dead.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Well, well, then softly;&mdash;you will alarm the Countess.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-center"><i>Enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Baron</span>.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> What is the matter? Why all this noise?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> Noise? why&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Be not alarmed, my lord. Whatever may have happened, the dear
child is now at least safe. You said so, I think, master Peter?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> Why, to be sure, his little Excellency is not hurt; but he's very
wet though: and the Count is taking him by the garden door to the
house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Right, that the countess may not be alarmed. But tell us, young
man, how could it happen?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> From beginning to end?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Never mind particulars. You attended the dear child?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> True.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Into the park?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> True.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> And then you went to the river?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> True.&mdash;Why, rabbit it, I believe you're a witch.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Well, and what happened further?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> Why, you see, his dear little Excellency would see the bridge,
that father built out of the old summer house; and the streamers, and
the boat, and all that.&mdash;I only turned my head round for a moment, to
look after a magpie&mdash;crush! down went the bridge, with his little
Excellency; and oh, how I was scared to see him carried down the river!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> And you drew him out again directly?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> No, I didn't.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> No; your father did?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> No, he didn't.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Why you did not leave him in the water?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> Yes, we did!&mdash;But we bawled as loud as we could; you might have
heard us down to the village.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Ay&mdash;and so the people came immediately to his assistance.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Pet.</i> No, they didn't: but the Stranger came, that lives yonder, close
to old Toby, and never speaks a syllable. Odsbodlikins! what a devil of
a fellow it is! With a single spring bounces he slap into the torrent;
sails and dives about and about like a duck; gets me hold of the little
angel's hair, and, Heaven bless him! pulls him safe and sound to dry
land again.&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Is the Stranger with them?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

Countess, present their respectful compliments, and request the honour
of your company at a family supper this evening.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> I shall not come.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Char.</i> But you'll scarce send such an uncivil answer as this. The Count
is overpowered with gratitude. You saved his son's life.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> I did it willingly.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Char.</i> And won't accept of, "I thank you," in return?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> No.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Char.</i> You really are cruel, sir, I must tell you. There are three of
us ladies at the Castle, and we are all dying with curiosity to know who
you are. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Stranger</span>.] The master is crabbed enough, however. Let
me try what I can make of the man. Pray, sir&mdash; [<span class="smcap">Francis</span> <i>turns his back
to her.</i>] &mdash;The beginning promises little enough. Friend, why won't you
look at me.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> I like to look at green trees better than green eyes.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Char.</i> Green eyes, you monster! Who told you, that my eyes were green?
Let me tell you there have been sonnets made on my eyes, before now.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Glad to hear it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Char.</i> To the point then at once. What is your master?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> A man.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Char.</i> I surmised as much. But what's his name?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> The same as his father's.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Char.</i> Not unlikely;&mdash;and his father was&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Married.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Char.</i> To whom?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> To a woman.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Char.</i> [<i>Enraged.</i>] I'll tell you what; who your master is I see I
shall not learn, and I don't care; but I know what you are.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Well, what am I?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Char.</i> A bear!</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Thank you! Now to see how habit and example corrupt one's
manners. I am naturally the civilest spoken fellow in the world to the
pretty prattling rogues; yet, following my master's humour, I've rudely
driven this wench away. I must have a peep at her though.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Francis!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Sir.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> We must be gone too.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> But whither?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> I don't care.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> I'll attend you.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> To any place?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> To death.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Heav'n grant it&mdash;to me, at least! There is peace.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Peace is every where. Let the storm rage without, if the heart be
but at rest. Yet I think we are very well where we are: the situation is
inviting; and nature lavish of her beauties, and of her bounties too.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> But I am not a wild beast, to be stared at, and sent for as a
show. Is it fit I should be?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Another of your interpretations! That a man, the life of whose
only son you have saved, should invite you to his house, seems to me not
very unnatural.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> I will not be invited to any house.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> For once, methinks, you might submit. You'll not be asked a
second time.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Proud wretches! They believe the most essential service is
requited, if one may but have the honour of sitting at their table. Let
us begone.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Yet hold, sir! This bustle will soon be over. Used to the town,
the Count and his party will soon be tired of simple nature, and you
will again be freed from observation.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Not from your's.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> This is too much. Do I deserve your doubts?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Am I in the wrong?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> You are indeed!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Francis, my servant, you are my only friend.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> That title makes amends for all.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> But look, Francis; there are uniforms and gay dresses in the
walk again. No, I must be gone. Here I'll stay no longer.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Well then, I'll tie up my bundle.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> The sooner the better! They come this way. Now must I shut
myself in my hovel, and lose this fine breeze. Nay, if they be your
highbred class of all, they may have impudence enough to walk into my
chamber. Francis, I shall lock the door.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Goes into the Lodge, locks the door, and fastens the shutters.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> And I'll be your centinel.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Very well.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Now should these people be as inquisitive as their maid, I must
summon my whole stock of impertinence. But their questions and my
answers need little study. They can learn nothing of the Stranger from
me; for the best of all possible reasons&mdash;I know nothing myself.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Baron</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Countess</span>.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> There is a strange face. The servant probably.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Friend, can we speak to your master?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> No.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Only for a few minutes.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> He has locked himself in his room.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Tell him a lady waits for him.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Then he's sure not to come.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Does he hate our sex?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> He hates the whole human race, but woman particularly.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> And why?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> He may perhaps have been deceived.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> This is not very courteous.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> My master is not over courteous: but when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> he sees a chance of
saving a fellow creature's life, he'll attempt it at the hazard of his
own.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> You are right. Now hear the reason of our visit. The wife and
brother-in-law of the man, whose child your master has saved, wish to
acknowledge their obligations to him.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> That he dislikes. He only wishes to live unnoticed.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> He appears to be unfortunate.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Appears!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> An affair of honour, perhaps, or some unhappy attachment may
have&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> They may.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Be this as it may, I wish to know who he is.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> So do I.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> What! don't you know him yourself?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Oh! I know him well enough. I mean his real self&mdash;His heart&mdash;his
soul&mdash;his worth&mdash;his honour!&mdash;Perhaps you think one knows a man, when
one is acquainted with his name and person.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> 'Tis well said, friend; you please me much. And now I should
like to know you. Who are you?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Your humble servant.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> This is affectation! A desire to appear singular! Every one
wishes to make himself distinguished. One sails round the world; another
creeps into a hovel.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> And the man apes his master!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Come, brother, let us seek the Count. He and Mrs. Haller
turned into the lawn&mdash;</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Going.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Stay. First a word or two, sister. I am in love.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> For the hundreth time.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> For the first time in my life.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> I wish you joy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Till now you have evaded my inquiries. Who is she? I beseech you,
sister, be serious. There is a time for all things.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Bless us! Why you look as if you were going to raise a
spirit. Don't fix your eyes so earnestly. Well, if I am to be serious, I
obey. I do not know who Mrs. Haller is, as I have already told you; but
what I do know of her, shall not be concealed from you. It may now be
three years ago, when, one evening, about twilight, a lady was
announced, who wished to speak to me in private. Mrs. Haller appeared
with all that grace and modesty, which have enchanted you. Her features,
at that moment, bore keener marks of the sorrow and confusion which have
since settled into gentle melancholy. She threw herself at my feet; and
besought me to save a wretch who was on the brink of despair. She told
me she had heard much of my benevolence, and offered herself as a
servant to attend me. I endeavoured to dive into the cause of her
sufferings, but in vain. She concealed her secret; yet opened to me more
and more each day a heart, chosen by virtue as her temple, and an
understanding improved by the most refined attainments. She no longer
remained my servant, but became my friend; and, by her own desire, has
ever since resided here. [<i>Curtseying.</i>] Brother, I have done.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Too little to satisfy my curiosity; yet enough to make me realise
my project. Sister, lend me your aid&mdash;I would marry her.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> You!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> I.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Baron Steinfort.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> For shame! If I understand you!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Not so harsh, and not so hasty! Those great sentiments of
contempt of inequality in rank are very fine in a romance; but we happen
not to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> inhabitants of an ideal world. How could you introduce her to
the circle we live in? You surely would not attempt to present her to&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Object as you will&mdash;my answer is&mdash;<i>I love.</i> Sister, you see a man
before you, who&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Who wants a wife.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> No; who has deliberately poised advantage against disadvantage;
domestic ease and comfort against the false gaieties of fashion. I can
withdraw into the country. I need no honours to make my tenants happy;
and my heart will teach me to make their happiness my own. With such a
wife as this, children who resemble her, and fortune enough to spread
comfort around me, what would the soul of man have more?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> This is all vastly fine. I admire your plan; only you seem
to have forgotten one trifling circumstance.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> And that is&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Whether Mrs. Haller will have you or not.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> There, sister, I just want your assistance.&mdash;[<i>Seizing her
hand.</i>] Good Henrietta!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Well, here's my hand. I'll do all I can for you. St!&mdash;We had

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Custom, my lord. You need only take the same walk every day
for a month.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Count.</i> Yes; if I wanted to resemble my greyhounds.&mdash;But what said the
Stranger?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> He gave Charlotte a flat refusal; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> you see his door, and
even his shutters, are closed against us.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Count.</i> What an unaccountable being! But it won't do. I must show my
gratitude one way or other. Steinfort, we will take the ladies home, and
then you shall try once again to see him. You can talk to these oddities
better than I can.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> If you wish it, with all my heart.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Well, Mrs. Haller, how do you like the man that just now
left us?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Who?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> My brother.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> He deserves to be your brother.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> [<i>Curtseying.</i>] Your most obedient! That shall be written in
my pocket-book.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Without flattery then, madam, he appears to be most amiable.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Good!&mdash;And a handsome man?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> [<i>With indifference.</i>] Oh, yes.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> "Oh, yes!" It sounded almost like, "Oh, no!" But I must tell
you, that he looks upon you to be a handsome woman [<span class="smcap">Mrs. Haller</span>
<i>smiles.</i>] You make no reply to this?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> What shall I reply? Derision never fell from your lips; and I
am little calculated to support it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> As little as you are calculated to be the cause of it. No; I
was in earnest.&mdash;Now?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> You confuse me!&mdash;But why should I play the prude? I will own
there was a time, when I thought myself handsome. 'Tis past. Alas! the
enchanting beauties of a female countenance arise from peace of
mind&mdash;The look, which captivates an honourable man, must be reflected
from a noble soul.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Then Heaven grant my bosom may ever hold as pure a heart, as
now those eyes bear witness lives in yours!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> [<i>With sudden wildness.</i>] Oh! Heaven forbid!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> [<i>Astonished.</i>] How!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> [<i>Checking her tears.</i>] Spare me! I am a wretch. The
sufferings of three years can give me no claim to your friendship&mdash;No,
not even to your compassion. Oh! spare me!</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Going.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Stay, Mrs. Haller. For the first time, I beg your
confidence.&mdash;My brother loves you.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> [<i>Starting, and gazing full in the face of the</i> <span class="smcap">Countess</span>.] For
mirth, too much&mdash;for earnest, too mournful!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> I revere that modest blush. Discover to me who you are. You
risk nothing. Pour all your griefs into a sister's bosom. Am I not kind?
and can I not be silent?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Alas! But a frank reliance on a generous mind is the greatest
sacrifice to be offered by true repentance. This sacrifice I will offer.
[<i>Hesitating.</i>] Did you never hear&mdash;Pardon me&mdash;Did you never hear&mdash;Oh!
how shocking is it to unmask a deception, which alone has recommended me
to your regard! But it must be so.&mdash;Madam&mdash;Fie, Adelaide! does pride
become you? Did you never hear of the Countess Waldbourg?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> I think I did hear, at the neighbouring court, of such a
creature. She plunged an honour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>able husband into misery. She ran away
with a villain.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> She did indeed. [<i>Falls at the feet of the</i> <span class="smcap">Countess</span>.] Do not
cast me from you.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> For Heaven's sake! You are&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> I am that wretch.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> [<i>Turning from her with horror.</i>] Ha!&mdash;Begone! [<i>Going. Her
heart draws her back.</i>] Yet, she is unfortunate: she is unfriended! Her
image is repentance&mdash;Her life the proof&mdash;She has wept her fault in her
three years agony. Be still awhile, remorseless prejudice, and let the
genuine feelings of my soul avow&mdash;they do not truly honour virtue, who
can insult the erring heart that would return to her sanctuary.
[<i>Looking with sorrow on her.</i>] Rise, I beseech you, rise! My husband
and my brother may surprise us. I promise to be silent.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Raising her.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Yes, you will be silent&mdash;But, oh! conscience! conscience! thou
never wilt be silent. [<i>Clasping her hands.</i>] Do not cast me from you.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Never! Your lonely life, your silent anguish and contrition,
may at length atone your crime. And never shall you want an asylum,
where your penitence may lament your loss. Your crime was youth and
inexperience; your heart never was, never could be concerned in it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Oh! spare me! My conscience never martyrs me so horribly, as
when I catch my base thoughts in search of an excuse! No, nothing can
palliate my guilt; and the only just consolation left me, is, to acquit
the man I wronged, and own I erred without a cause of fair complaint.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> And this is the mark of true repentance. Alas! my friend,
when superior sense, recommended too by superior charms of person,
assail a young, though wedded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Ah! not even that mean excuse is left me. In all that merits
admiration, respect, and love, he was far, far beneath my husband. But
to attempt to account for my strange infatuation&mdash;I cannot bear it. I
thought my husband's manner grew colder to me. 'Tis true I knew, that
his expenses, and his confidence in deceitful friends, had embarrassed
his means, and clouded his spirits; yet I thought he denied me pleasures
and amusements still within our reach. My vanity was mortified! My
confidence not courted. The serpent tongue of my seducer promised every
thing. But never could such arguments avail, till, assisted by forged
letters, and the treachery of a servant, whom I most confided in, he
fixed my belief that my lord was false, and that all the coldness I
complained of was disgust to me, and love for another; all his home
retrenchments but the means of satisfying a rival's luxury. Maddened
with this conviction, (conviction it was, for artifice was most
ingenious in its proof,) I left my children&mdash;father&mdash;husband&mdash;to
follow&mdash;a villain.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> But, with such a heart, my friend could not remain long in
her delusion?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Long enough to make sufficient penitence impossible. 'Tis true
that in a few weeks the delirium was at an end. Oh, what were my
sensations when the mist dispersed before my eyes? I called for my
husband, but in vain!&mdash;I listened for the prattle of my children, but in
vain!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> [<i>Embracing her.</i>] Here, here, on this bosom only shall your
future tears be shed; and may I, dear sufferer, make you again familiar
with hope!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Oh! impossible!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Have you never heard of your children?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Never.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> We must endeavour to gain some account of them. We
must&mdash;Hold! my husband and my brother! Oh, my poor brother! I had quite
forgotten him. Quick, dear Mrs. Haller, wipe your eyes. Let us meet
them.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Madam, I'll follow. Allow me a moment to compose
myself.&mdash;[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Countess</span>.] I pause!&mdash;Oh! yes&mdash;to compose myself!
[<i>Ironically.</i>] She little thinks it is but to gain one solitary moment
to vent my soul's remorse. Once the purpose of my unsettled mind was
self-destruction; Heaven knows how I have sued for hope and resignation.
I did trust my prayers were heard&mdash;Oh! spare me further trial! I feel, I
feel, my heart and brain can bear no more.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> I will announce you, sir; but it won't avail! I shall be abused,
and you rejected. However, we can but try.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Going.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> I only ask half a minute. [<span class="smcap">Francis</span> <i>goes into the Lodge.</i>] But
when he comes, how am I to treat him? I never encountered a misanthrope
before. I have heard of instructions as to conduct in society; but how I
am to behave towards a being who loathes the whole world, and his own
existence, I have never learned.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-center"><i>Enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Stranger</span>.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Now; what's your will?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> I beg pardon, sir, for&mdash;[<i>Suddenly recognizing him.</i>] Charles!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Steinfort!</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>They embrace.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Is it really you, my dear friend?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> It is.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Merciful Heavens! How you are altered!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> The hand of misery lies heavy on me.&mdash;But how came you here?
What want you?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Strange! Here was I ruminating how to address this mysterious
recluse: he appears, and proves to be my old and dearest friend.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Then you were not in search of me, nor knew that I lived here?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> As little as I know who lives on the summit of Caucasus. You this
morning saved the life of my brother-in-law's only son: a grateful
family wishes to behold you in its circle. You refused my sister's
messenger; therefore, to give more weight to the invitation, I was
deputed to be the bearer of it. And thus has fortune restored to me a
friend, whom my heart has so long missed, and whom my heart just now so
much requires.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Yes, I am your friend; your sincere friend. You are a true man;
an uncommon man. Towards you my heart is still the same. But if this
assurance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> be of any value to you&mdash;go&mdash;leave me&mdash;and return no more.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Stay! All that I see and hear of you is inexplicable. 'Tis you;
but these, alas! are not the features which once enchanted every female
bosom, beamed gaiety through all society, and won you friends before
your lips were opened! Why do you avert your face? Is the sight of a
friend become hateful? Or, do you fear, that I should read in your eye
what passes in your soul? Where is that open look of fire, which at once
penetrated into every heart, and revealed your own?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> [<i>With asperity.</i>] My look penetrate into every heart!&mdash;Ha! ha!
ha!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Oh, Heavens! Rather may I never hear you laugh than in such a
tone!&mdash;For Heaven's sake tell me, Charles! tell me, I conjure you, what
has happened to you?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Things that happen every day; occurrences heard of in every
street. Steinfort, if I am not to hate you, ask me not another question.
If I am to love you, leave me.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Oh, Charles! awake the faded ideas of past joys. Feel, that a
friend is near. Recollect the days we passed in Hungary, when we
wandered arm in arm upon the banks of the Danube, while nature opened
our hearts, and made us enamoured of benevolence and friendship. In
those blessed moments you gave me this seal as a pledge of your regard.
Do you remember it?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Yes.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Am I since that time become less worthy of your confidence?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> No!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Charles! it grieves me that I am thus compelled to enforce my
rights upon you. Do you know this scar?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Comrade! Friend! It received and resisted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> the stroke aimed at
my life. I have not forgotten it. Alas! you knew not what a present you
then made me.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Speak then, I beseech you.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> You cannot help me.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Then I can mourn with you.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> That I hate. Besides, I cannot weep.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Then give me words instead of tears. Both relieve the heart.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Relieve the heart! My heart is like a close-shut sepulchre. Let
what is within it, moulder and decay.&mdash;Why, why open the wretched
charnel-house to spread a pestilence around?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> How horrid are your looks! For shame! A man like you thus to
crouch beneath the chance of fortune!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Steinfort! I did think, that the opinion of all mankind was
alike indifferent to me; but I feel that it is not so. My friend, you
shall not quit me without learning how I have been robbed of every joy
which life afforded. Listen: much misery may be contained in a few
words. Attracted by my native country, I quitted you and the service.
What pleasing pictures did I draw of a life employed in improving
society, and diffusing happiness! I fixed on Cassel to be my abode. All
went on admirably. I found friends. At length, too, I found a wife; a
lovely, innocent creature, scarce sixteen years of age. Oh! how I loved
her! She bore me a son and a daughter. Both were endowed by nature with
the beauty of their mother. Ask me not how I loved my wife and children!
Yes, then, then I was really happy. [<i>Wiping his eyes.</i>] Ha! a tear! I
could not have believed it. Welcome, old friends! 'Tis long since we
have known each other. Well, my story is nearly ended. One of my
friends, for whom I had become engaged, treacherously lost me more than
half my fortune. This hurt me. I was obliged to retrench my expenses.
Contentment needs but little. I for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>gave him. Another friend&mdash;a villain!
to whom I was attached heart and soul; whom I had assisted with my
means, and promoted by my interest, this fiend! seduced my wife, and
bore her from me. Tell me, sir, is this enough to justify my hatred of
mankind, and palliate my seclusion from the
world?&mdash;Kings&mdash;laws&mdash;tyranny&mdash;or guilt can but imprison me, or kill me.
But, O God! O God! Oh! what are chains or death compared to the tortures
of a deceived yet doting husband!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> To lament the loss of a faithless wife is madness.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Call it what you please&mdash;say what you please&mdash;I love her still.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> And where is she?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> I know not, nor do I wish to know.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> And your children?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> I left them at a small town hard by.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> But why did you not keep your children with you? They would have
amused you in many a dreary hour.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Amused me! Oh, yes! while their likeness to their mother would
every hour remind me of my past happiness! No. For three years I have
never seen them. I hate that any human creature should be near me, young
or old! Had not ridiculous habits made a servant necessary, I should
long since have discharged him; though he is not the worst among the
bad.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Such too often are the consequences of great alliances.
Therefore, Charles, I have resolved to take a wife from a lower rank of
life.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> You marry!&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> You shall see her. She is in the house where you are expected.
Come with me.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> What! I mix again with the world!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> To do a generous action without requiring thanks is noble and
praise-worthy. But so obsti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>nately to avoid those thanks, as to make the
kindness a burden, is affectation.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Leave me! leave me! Every one tries to form a circle, of which
he may be the centre. As long as there remains a bird in these woods to
greet the rising sun with its melody, I shall court no other society.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Do as you please to-morrow; but give me your company this
evening.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> [<i>Resolutely.</i>] No!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Not though it were in your power, by this single visit, to secure
the happiness of your friend for life?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> [<i>Starting.</i>] Ha! then I must&mdash;But how?&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> You shall sue in my behalf to Mrs. Haller&mdash;You have the talent of
persuasion.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> I! my dear Steinfort!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> The happiness or misery of your friend depends upon it. I'll
contrive that you shall speak to her alone. Will you?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> I will; but upon one condition.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Name it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> That you allow me to be gone to-morrow, and not endeavour to
detain me.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Go! Whither?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> No matter! Promise this, or I will not come.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Well, I do promise. Come.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> I have directions to give my servant.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> In half an hour then we shall expect you. Remember, you have
given your word.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> I have. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Baron</span>.&mdash;<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Stranger</span> <i>walks up and down,

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> I shall leave this place to-morrow.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> With all my heart.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> With all my heart again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Perhaps into another quarter of the globe.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> With all my heart still. Into which quarter?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Wherever Heaven directs! Away! away! from Europe! From this
cultivated moral lazaret! Do you hear, Francis? To-morrow early.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Very well.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Going.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Come here, come here first, I have an errand for you. Hire that
carriage in the village; drive to the town hard by; you may be back by
sun-set. I shall give you a letter to a widow who lives there. With her
you will find two children. They are mine.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> [<i>Astonished.</i>] Your children, sir!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Take them, and bring them hither.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Your children, sir!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Yes, mine! Is it so very inconceivable?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> That I should have been three years in your service, and never
have heard them mentioned, is somewhat strange.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Pshaw!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> You have been married then?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Go, and prepare for our journey.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> That I can do in five minutes.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Going.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> I shall come and write the letter directly.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Very well, sir.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Yes, I'll take them with me. I'll accustom myself to the sight
of them. The innocents! they shall not be poisoned by the refinements of
society. Rather let them hunt their daily sustenance upon some desert
island with their bow and arrow; or creep, like torpid Hottentots, into
a corner, and stare at each other. Better to do nothing than to do evil.
Fool that I was, to be prevailed upon once more to exhibit myself among
these apes! What a ridiculous figure shall I be! and in the capacity of
a suitor too! Pshaw! he cannot be serious! 'Tis but a friendly artifice
to draw me from my solitude. Why did I promise him? Yes, my sufferings
have been many; and, to oblige a friend, why should I hesitate to add
another painful hour to the wretched calendar of my life! I'll go. I'll
go.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Char.</i> No, indeed, my lady! If you chuse to bury yourself in the
country, I shall take my leave. I am not calculated for a country life.
And, to sum up all, when I think of this Mrs. Haller&mdash;</p>

<p class="stage-dir-center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> [<i>Overhearing her last words.</i>] What of Mrs. Haller, my sweet
Miss?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Char.</i> Why, Mr. Solomon, who is Mrs. Haller? You know every thing; you
hear every thing.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> I have received no letters from any part of Europe on the
subject, Miss.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Char.</i> But who is to blame? The Count and Countess. She dines with
them; and at this very moment is drinking tea with them. Is this proper?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> By no means.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Char.</i> Shouldn't a Count and a Countess, in all their actions, show a
certain degree of pride and pomposity?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> To be sure! To be sure they should!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Char.</i> No, I won't submit to it. I'll tell her ladyship, when I dress
her to-morrow, that either Mrs. Haller or I must quit the house.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> [<i>Seeing the</i> <span class="smcap">Baron</span>.] St!</p>

<p class="stage-dir-center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Baron</span>.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Didn't I hear Mrs. Haller's name here?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> [<i>Confused.</i>] Why&mdash;yes&mdash;we&mdash;we&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Charlotte, tell my sister I wish to see her as soon as the
tea-table is removed.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Char.</i> [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>.] Either she or I go, that I'm determined.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> May I ask what it was you were saying?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> Why, please your Honourable Lordship, we were talking here and
there&mdash;this and that&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> I almost begin to suspect some secret.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> Secret! Heaven forbid! Mercy on us! No! I should have had letters
on the subject if there had been a secret.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Well then, since it was no secret, I presume I may know your
conversation.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> You do us great honour, my lord. Why, then, at first, we were
making a few common-place observations. Miss Charlotte remarked that we
had all our faults. I said, "Yes." Soon after I remarked that the best
persons in the world were not without their weaknesses. She said, "Yes."</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> If you referred to Mrs. Haller's faults and weaknesses, I am
desirous to hear more.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> Sure enough, sir, Mrs. Haller is an excellent woman; but she's
not an angel for all that. I am an old faithful servant to his
Excellency the Count, and therefore it is my duty to speak, when any
thing is done disadvantageous to his interest.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Well!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> For instance, now; his Excellency may think he has at least some
score of dozens of the old six-and-twenty hock. Mercy on us! there are
not ten dozen bottles left; and not a drop has gone down my throat, I'll
swear.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> [<i>Smiling.</i>] Mrs. Haller has not drank it, I suppose?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> Not she herself, for she never drinks wine. But if any body be
ill in the village, any poor woman lying-in, away goes a bottle of the
six-and-twenty! Innumerable are the times that I've reproved her; but
she always answers me snappishly, that she will be responsible for it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> So will I, Mr. Solomon.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> Oh! with all my heart, your Honourable Lordship. It makes no
difference to me. I had the care of the cellar twenty years, and can
safely take my oath, that I never gave the poor a single drop in the
whole course of my trust.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> How extraordinary is this woman!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> Extraordinary! One can make nothing of her. To-day, the vicar's
wife is not good enough for her. To-morrow, you may see her sitting with
all the women of the village. To be sure she and I agree pretty well;
for, between me and your Honourable Lordship, she has cast an eye upon
my son Peter.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Has she?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> Yes&mdash;Peter's no fool, I assure you. The schoolmaster is teaching
him to write. Would your Honourable Lordship please to see a specimen;
I'll go for his copy-book. He makes his pothooks capitally.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Another time, another time. Good bye for the present, Mr.
Solomon. [<span class="smcap">Solomon</span> <i>bows, without attempting to go.</i>] Good day, Mr.
Solomon.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> [<i>Not understanding the hint.</i>] Your Honourable Lordship's most
obedient servant.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Mr. Solomon I wish to be alone.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Sol.</i> As your lordship commands. If the time should seem long in my
absence, and your lordship wishes to hear the newest news from the seat
of war, you need only send for old Solomon. I have letters from Leghorn,
Cape Horn, and every known part of the habitable globe.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Excuse my making a reply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> I thank you for your sisterly affection, and the explicitness of
your communications. Luckily, I placed little reliance on either; and
have found a friend, who will save your ladyship all further trouble.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> A friend!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Yes. The Stranger who saved your son's life this morning proves
to be my intimate friend.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> What's his name?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> I don't know.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Is he of a good family?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> I can't tell.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Will he come hither?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Excuse my making a reply.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Well, the retort is fair&mdash;but insufferable.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> You can't object to the <i>Da Capo</i> of your own composition,</p>

with marble legs? There you leave me <i>t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te</i> with Mrs. Haller, as
if my heart were a mere flint. So you prevailed, brother. The Stranger
will come then, it seems.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> I expect him every minute.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Count.</i> I'm glad to hear it. One companion more, however. In the
country we never can have too many.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> This gentleman will not exactly be an addition to your circle,
for he leaves this place tomorrow.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Count.</i> But he won't, I think. Now, Lady Wintersen, summon all your
charms. There is no art in conquering us poor devils; but this strange
man, who does not care a doit for you all together, is worth your
efforts. Try your skill. I shan't be jealous.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> I allow the conquest to be worth the trouble. But what Mrs.
Haller has not been able to affect in three months, ought not to be
attempted by me.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> [<i>Jocosely.</i>] Oh, yes, madam. He has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> given me no opportunity

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> I am quite well. Do not alarm yourselves on my account.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Madam, pardon my intrusion; but to lose a moment may be fatal. He
means to quit the country to-morrow. We must devise means to reconcile
you to&mdash;the Stranger.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> How, my lord! You seem acquainted with my history?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> I am. Walbourg has been my friend ever since we were boys. We
served together from the rank of cadet. We have been separated seven
years. Chance brought us this day together, and his heart was open to
me.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Now do I feel what it is to be in the presence of an honest
man, when I dare not meet his eye.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Hides her face.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> If sincere repentance, if years without reproach, do not give us
a title to man's forgiveness, what must we expect hereafter? No, lovely
penitent! your contrition is complete. Error for a moment wrested from
slumbering virtue the dominion of your heart; but she awoke, and, with a
look, banished her enemy for ever. I know my friend. He has the firmness
of a man; but, with it, the gentlest feelings of your sex. I hasten to
him. With the fire of pure disinterested friendship will I enter on this
work; that, when I look back upon my past life, I may derive from this
good action consolation in disappointment, and even resignation in
despair.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Going.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Oh, stay! What would you do? No! never! My husband's honour is
sacred to me. I love him unutterably: but never, never can I be his wife
again; even if he were generous enough to pardon me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Madam! Can you, Countess, be serious?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs H.</i> Not that title, I beseech you! I am not a child, who wishes to
avoid deserved punishment. What were my penitence, if I hoped advantage
from it beyond the consciousness of atonement for past offence?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> But if your husband himself&mdash;?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Oh! he will not! he cannot! And let him rest assured I never
would replace my honour at the expense of his.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> He still loves you.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Loves me! Then he must not&mdash;No&mdash;he must purify his heart from
a weakness which would degrade him!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Incomparable woman! I go to my friend&mdash;perhaps, for the last
time! Have you not one word to send him?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Yes, I have two requests to make. Often when, in excess of
grief, I have despaired of every consolation, I have thought I should be
easier if I might behold my husband once again, acknowledge my injustice
to him, and take a gentle leave of him for ever. This, therefore, is my
first request&mdash;a conversation for a few short minutes, if he does not
quite abhor the sight of me. My second request is&mdash;Oh&mdash;not to see, but
to hear some account of my poor children.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> If humanity and friendship can avail, he will not for a moment
delay your wishes.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Heaven be with you.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> And my prayers.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Baron</span>.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Come, my friend, come into the air, till he returns with
hope and consolation.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Oh, my heart! How art thou afflicted! My husband! My little
ones! Past joys and future fears&mdash;Oh, dearest madam, there are moments
in which we live years! Moments, which steal the roses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> from the cheek
of health, and plough deep furrows in the brow of youth.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Banish these sad reflections. Come, let us walk. The sun
will set soon; let nature's beauties dissipate anxiety.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Alas! Yes, the setting sun is a proper scene for me.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Countess.</i> Never forget a morning will succeed.</p>

<h3>SCENE II.</h3>

<p class="stage-dir-center"><i>The skirts of the Park, Lodge, &amp;c. as before.</i></p>

<p class="stage-dir-center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Baron</span>.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> On earth there is but one such pair. They shall not be parted.
Yet what I have undertaken is not so easy as I at first hoped. What can
I answer when he asks me, whether I would persuade him to renounce his
character, and become the derision of society? For he is right: a
faithless wife is a dishonour! and to forgive her, is to share her
shame. What though Adelaide may be an exception; a young deluded girl,
who has so long and so sincerely repented, yet what cares an unfeeling
world for this? The world! he has quitted it. 'Tis evident he loves her
still; and upon this assurance builds my sanguine heart the hope of a
happy termination to an honest enterprise.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Francis</span> <i>with two Children</i>, <span class="smcap">William</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Amelia</span>.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Come along, my pretty ones&mdash;come.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Will.</i> Is it far to home?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> No, we shall be there directly, now.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Hold! Whose children are these?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> My master's.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Will.</i> Is that my father?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> It darts like lightning through my brain. A word with you. I know
you love your master. Strange things have happened here. Your master has
found his wife again.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Indeed! Glad to hear it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Mrs. Haller&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Is she his wife? Still more glad to hear it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> But he is determined to go from her.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Oh!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> We must try to prevent it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Surely.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> The unexpected appearance of the children may perhaps assist us.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> How so?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Hide yourself with them in that hut. Before a quarter of an hour
is passed you shall know more.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> But&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> No more questions, I entreat you. Time is precious.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> Well, well: questions are not much in my way. Come, children.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Will.</i> Why, I thought you told me I should see my father.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Fra.</i> So you shall, my dear. Come, moppets.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Goes into the Hut with the Children.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Excellent! I promise myself much from this little artifice. If
the mild look of the mother fails, the innocent smiles of these his own
children will surely find the way to his heart. [<i>Taps at the Lodge
door, the</i> <span class="smcap">Stranger</span> <i>comes out.</i>] Charles, I wish you joy.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Of what?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> You have found her again.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Show a bankrupt the treasure which he once possessed, and then
congratulate him on the amount!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Why not, if it be in your power to retrieve the whole?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> I understand you: you are a negociator from my wife. It won't
avail.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Learn to know your wife better. Yes, I am a messenger from her;
but without power to treat. She, who loves you unutterably, who without
you never can be happy, renounces your forgiveness; because, as she
thinks, your honour is incompatible with such a weakness.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Pshaw! I am not to be caught.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Charles! consider well&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Steinfort, let me explain all this. I have lived here four
months. Adelaide knew it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Knew it! She never saw you till to-day.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> That you may make fools believe. Hear further: she knows too,
that I am not a common sort of man; that my heart is not to be attacked
in the usual way. She, therefore, framed a deep concerted plan. She
played a charitable part; but in such a way, that it always reached my
ears. She played a pious, modest, reserved part, in order to excite my
curiosity. And at last, to-day she plays the prude. She refuses my
forgiveness, in hopes by this generous device, to extort it from my
compassion.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Charles! I have listened to you with astonishment. This is a
weakness only to be pardoned in a man who has so often been deceived by
the world. Your wife has expressly and stedfastly declared, that she
will not accept your forgiveness, even if you yourself were weak enough
to offer it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> What then has brought you hither?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> More than one reason. First, I am come in my own name, as your
friend and comrade, to conjure you solemnly not to spurn this creature
from you; for, by my soul, you will not find her equal.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Give yourself no further trouble.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Be candid, Charles. You love her still.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Alas! yes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Her sincere repentance has long since obliterated her crime.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Sir! a wife, once induced to forfeit her honour, must be capable
of a second crime.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Not so, Charles. Ask your heart what portion of the blame may be
your own.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Mine!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Yours. Who told you to marry a thoughtless inexperienced girl?
One scarce expects established principles at five-and-twenty in a man,
yet you require them in a girl of sixteen! But of this no more. She has
erred; she has repented; and, during three years, her conduct has been
so far above reproach, that even the piercing eye of calumny has not
discovered a speck upon this radiant orb.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Now, were I to believe all this&mdash;and I confess that I would
willingly believe it&mdash;yet can she never again be mine. [<i>With extreme
asperity.</i>] Oh! what a feast would it be for the painted dolls and
vermin of the world, when I appeared among them with my runaway wife
upon my arm! What mocking, whispering, pointing!&mdash;Never! Never! Never!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Enough! As a friend I have done my duty: I now appear as
Adelaide's ambassador. She requests one moment's conversation. She
wishes once again to see you, and never more! You cannot deny her this,
this only, this last, request.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Oh! I understand this too: she thinks my firmness will be melted
by her tears: she is mistaken. She may come.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> She will come, to make you feel how much you mistake her. I go
for her.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Another word.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> Another word!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Give her this paper, and these jewels. They belong to her.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Presenting them.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Bar.</i> That you may do yourself.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> The last anxious moment of my life draws<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> near. I shall see her
once again; I shall see her, on whom my soul doats. Is this the language
of an injured husband? What is this principle which we call honour? Is
it a feeling of the heart, or a quibble in the brain? I must be
resolute: it cannot now be otherwise. Let me speak solemnly, yet mildly;
and beware that nothing of reproach escape my lips. Yes, her penitence
is real. She shall not be obliged to live in mean dependence: she shall
be mistress of herself, she shall&mdash; [<i>Looks round and shudders.</i>] Ha!
they come. Awake, insulted pride! Protect me, injured honour!</p>

<p class="stage-dir-center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Haller</span>, <span class="smcap">Countess</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Baron</span>.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> [<i>Advances slowly, and in a tremour.</i> <span class="smcap">Countess</span> <i>attempts to
support her.</i>] Leave me now, I beseech you. [<i>Approaches the</i> <span class="smcap">Stranger</span>,
<i>who, with averted countenance, and in extreme agitation, awaits her
address.</i>] My lord!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> [<i>With gentle tremulous utterance, and face still turned away.</i>]
What would you with me, Adelaide?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> [<i>Much agitated.</i>] No&mdash;for Heaven's sake! I was not prepared
for this&mdash;Adelaide!&mdash;No, no. For Heaven's sake!&mdash;Harsh tones alone are
suited to a culprit's ear.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> [<i>Endeavouring to give his voice firmness.</i>] Well, madam!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Oh! if you will ease my heart, if you will spare and pity me,
use reproaches.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Reproaches! Here they are; here on my sallow cheek&mdash;here in my
hollow eye&mdash;here in my faded form. These reproaches I could not spare
you.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Were I a hardened sinner, this forbearance would be charity:
but I am a suffering penitent, and it overpowers me. Alas! then I must
be the herald of my own shame. For, where shall I find peace, till I
have eased my soul by my confession?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> No confession, madam. I release you from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> every humiliation. I
perceive you feel, that we must part for ever.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> I know it. Nor come I here to supplicate your pardon; nor has
my heart contained a ray of hope that you would grant it. All I dare ask
is, that you will not curse my memory.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> [<i>Moved.</i>] No, I do not curse you. I shall never curse you.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> [<i>Agitated.</i>] From the conviction that I am unworthy of your
name, I have, during three years abandoned it. But this is not enough;
you must have that redress which will enable you to chuse
another&mdash;another wife; in whose chaste arms, may Heaven protect your
hours in bliss! This paper will be necessary for the purpose: it
contains a written acknowledgement of my guilt.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Offers it,
trembling.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> [<i>Tearing it.</i>] Perish the record, for ever.&mdash;No, Adelaide, you
only have possessed my heart; and, I am not ashamed to own it, you alone
will reign there for ever.&mdash;Your own sensations of virtue, your resolute
honour, forbid you to profit by my weakness; and even if&mdash;Now, by
Heaven, this is beneath a man! But&mdash;never&mdash;never will another fill
Adelaide's place here.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> [<i>Trembling.</i>] Then nothing now remains but that one sad,
hard, just word&mdash;farewell!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Stay a moment. For some months we have, without knowing it,
lived near each other. I have learnt much good of you. You have a heart
open to the wants of your fellow creatures. I am happy that it is so.
You shall not be without the power of gratifying your benevolence. I
know you have a spirit that must shrink from a state of obligation. This
paper, to which the whole remnant of my fortune is pledged, secures you
independence, Adelaide: and let the only recommendation of the gift be,
that it will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> administer to you the means of indulging in charity, the
divine propensity of your nature.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> Never! To the labour of my hands alone will I owe my
sustenance. A morsel of bread, moistened with the tear of penitence,
will suffice my wishes, and exceed my merits. It would be an additional
reproach, to think that I served myself, or even others, from the bounty
of the man whom I had so deeply injured.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> Take it, madam; take it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> I have deserved this. But I throw myself upon your generosity.
Have compassion on me!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Villain! of what a woman hast thou robbed me!&mdash;
[<i>Puts up the paper.</i>] Well, madam, I respect your sentiments, and
withdraw my request; but on condition, that if you ever should be in
want of any thing, I may be the first and only person in the world, to
whom you will make application.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> I promise it, my lord.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Stra.</i> And now I may, at least, desire you to take back what is your
own&mdash;your jewels.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i>Gives her the casket.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>Mrs. H.</i> [<i>Opens it in violent agitation, and her tears burst upon
it.</i>] How well do I recollect the sweet evening when you gave me these!

oath of eternal fidelity.&mdash;It is broken. This locket, you gave me on my
birthday&mdash;That was a happy day! We had a country feast&mdash;How cheerful we
all were!&mdash;This bracelet, I received after my William was born! No! take
them&mdash;take them&mdash;I cannot keep these, unless you wish, that the sight of
them should be an incessant reproach to my almost broken heart.</p>

them for ever.</p>
